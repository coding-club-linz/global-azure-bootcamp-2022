DESCRIPTION:Global Azure Austria: GAA: To Containers and Beyond - Kubernetes as a Universal Control Plane\n\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nKubernetes has evolved beyond container orchestration - it is a powerful tool for managing diverse resources, from deployments to infrastructure and cloud resources. It is designed for extensibility and offers a robust foundation for more than just deployments. \n\nThis talk will dive into the exciting world of extending Kubernetes. We'll explore how Crossplane, an open source CNCF project, takes Kubernetes to a new level and enhances it to a versatile control plane. Further, it'll cover how GitOps can boost this powerful combination by providing automation, security, improved collaboration and more.\n\n---\n\nVisit https://globalazure.at/ for more information
