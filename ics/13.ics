DESCRIPTION:Global Azure Austria: GAA: Between Skills, Sales & Success - Leading Through AI-Driven Transformation at Microsoft\n\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nWhat does it mean to lead a sales and tech team in a world shaped by AI, innovation, and constant change? In this session, I'll share my personal journey as a Data & AI & App Innovation Sales Manager at Microsoft – leading a male-dominated team, navigating rapid upskilling, and learning what leadership really means when the ground is constantly shifting.\n\nYou’ll hear real stories from the field: how Austrian customers are rethinking their business models with Azure, what it takes to sell innovation in an AI-first world, and how trust, empathy, and continuous learning can become superpowers in tech leadership. This talk is not about technology alone - it's about mindset, momentum, and making meaningful impact in times of transformation.\n\n---\n\nVisit https://globalazure.at/ for more information
