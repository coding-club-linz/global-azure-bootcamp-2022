DESCRIPTION:Global Azure Austria: GAA: Infrastructure as Code and AI - does it fit?\n\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nInfrastructure as Code is crucial for the cloud native development. It allows you to automate the deployment of your resources and comes with a lot of other benefits.\nHow does Infrastructure as Code harmonize with AI tools like the GitHub Copilot?\nI wanted to investigate the matter and examine how well AI tools can be applied to several use cases related to Infrastructure as Code: for code generation, code interpretation, and error analysis. I intend to publish the results of this session.\n\n\n---\n\nVisit https://globalazure.at/ for more information
