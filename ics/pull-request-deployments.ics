DESCRIPTION:Global Azure Austria: GAA: Fast feedback with pull request deployments\n\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nA modern DevOps process would no longer be possible without feature branches and pull request workflows. How are the changes of a pull request verified? Often, only a deployment into an isolated PR environment provides clarity. This allows testing in the overall context with surrounding systems and real data persistence, the deployment and upgrade process can be tested as well and last but not least a product owner can look at the change on a running system. \n\nThis talk will show everything that is needed for a pull request deployment and also show approaches for challenges like database schema deployment with data initialization as well as regression testing. The examples will be presented using Azure DevOps and Azure Kubernetes Services.\n\n---\n\nVisit https://globalazure.at/streaming/ for instructions how to join and view
