DESCRIPTION:Global Azure Austria: GAA: Keynote: Pioneering the Future of Java with Intelligent Apps\n\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nDisruptive changes are so called because they cut across traditional boundaries in whatever domain it is they are disrupting. This 45-minute keynote from 30-year software industry veteran Ed Burns explores the ways that AI can be practically applied in a typical contemporary cloud-native Java Azure application deployment. First, Let’s acknowledge two foundational truths about the use of AI in Java apps:\n\n1. Within most line-of-business (LOB) applications the act of using AI is just another API call, usually with the builder pattern. In other words, the usual forces of abstraction/removal of boilerplate/use of existing patterns/design for adoption/frictionless APIs/etc. mean it’s easy to get started.\n2. LOB apps, including Java apps, in the cloud are just one part of much larger systems, most of which go well beyond Java.   \n\nTo satisfy your curiosity about aspect 1., Ed gives a brief overview of two popular LOB programming language level projects that are incentivized to empower developers to use AI: Semantic Kernel and LangChain. To satisfy your curiosity about aspect 2., Ed surveys the current state of the art in AIOps in Azure.  \nTopics covered include:  \n\n- What is LangChain and Semantic Kernel? What is the Java language usage pattern?  \n- What are some historical perspectives and value choices for each?  \n- What is the state of the art for continuing to derive value from existing legacy enterprise Java software line-of-business (LOB) applications?  \n- What is Ed’s insight on Azure’s AI play for LOB apps?  \n\nAfter this talk, you will have been introduced to two app level ways to use AI in LOB apps and you will understand the importance of AI going beyond the programming language level to the other aspects of your entire IT estate on Azure.  \n\n\n---\n\nVisit https://globalazure.at/ for more information
