DESCRIPTION:Global Azure Austria: GAA: Deployment Strategy for Multi-Tenant Capable Azure Applications Using Azure DevOps Pipelines\n\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nIn many of my projects over the past few years, the focus has increasingly shifted beyond general software architecture to include the development of hosting and deployment strategies. These strategies are designed to enable the operation of a shared hosting infrastructure for a wide range of customers, while also allowing for staggered updates to be rolled out over an extended period of time. This results in the need to run multiple versions of the software in parallel. In addition to a dynamic set of development and test systems, it quickly became clear that the setup of these environments had to be automated. As a side effect of this deployment automation, the possibility also emerged to create targeted, temporary test environments for feature branches, enabling testing on a setup that closely mirrors the production environment.\n\n---\n\nVisit https://globalazure.at/ for more information
