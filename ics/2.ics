DESCRIPTION:Global Azure Austria: GAA: Declarative Agents in M365 with REST API Integration\n\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nDeclarative Agents in Microsoft 365 open up new possibilities for interacting with data and external systems. In this session, I will demonstrate through examples how to create such agents.\n\nOne agent assists with writing, while another retrieves information from an external system. We will explore the technical foundations, potential challenges, and practical benefits. After this session, you will understand how to integrate and effectively use your own declarative agents in M365.\n\n---\n\nVisit https://globalazure.at/ for more information
