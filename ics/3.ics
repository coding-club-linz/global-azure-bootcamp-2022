DESCRIPTION:Global Azure Austria: GAA: How to Deploy an OpenAI Service with a GPT-4 Model on Azure Using Terraform and GitHub Actions\n\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nProbably almost everyone has used AI-powered tools, like the GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or the Microsoft Copilot. But how do these Gen-AI tools work, and what resources are behind them in Azure?\n\nIn this session, I would like to delve into the individual components and explain the infrastructure behind an OpenAI Service using Terraform. I would like to demonstrate live how this service, including a GPT-4 deployment, can be provisioned and destroyed in an automated way using a GitHub Action Workflow. In addition, I want to explain how the public endpoints can be used to conduct the prompting.\n\n---\n\nVisit https://globalazure.at/ for more information
