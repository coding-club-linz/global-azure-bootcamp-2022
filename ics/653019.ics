DESCRIPTION:Global Azure Austria: GAA: Project Kappa - Or how we successfully failed to avoid our own Serverless platform\n\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nSometimes things look similar but are fundamentally different. Pasta with bacon and cream is not a Carbonara, the Mega Drive never was a Super Nintendo, and whatever Serverless solution you use, it is not AWS Lambda.\n\nWhile all of those comparisons make for some inner turmoil, especially the latter one caused severe problems when we tried to move our Serverless workloads to Azure. Simply because they do come with a challenge: Every developer at Dynatrace, every partner, and every customer should have the possibility to run privacy-first, isolated, and secure workloads on top of our data lake infrastructure.\n\nIn this talk, we will look at how Dynatrace managed to run their Serverless workloads on Azure, with a tailor-made, Kubernetes-based Serverless platform we so dearly tried to avoid at all costs. Not only will we look at the architecture at hand, but we will highlight every right decision that was paramount to solving this problem as painlessly as possible.\n\n---\n\nVisit https://globalazure.at/ for more information
