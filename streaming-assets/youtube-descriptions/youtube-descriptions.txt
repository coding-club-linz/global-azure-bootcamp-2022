To Containers and Beyond - Kubernetes as a Universal Control Plane
=============================================================================
Kubernetes has evolved beyond container orchestration - it is a powerful tool for managing diverse resources, from deployments to infrastructure and cloud resources. It is designed for extensibility and offers a robust foundation for more than just deployments.

This talk will dive into the exciting world of extending Kubernetes. We'll explore how Crossplane, an open source CNCF project, takes Kubernetes to a new level and enhances it to a versatile control plane. Further, it'll cover how GitOps can boost this powerful combination by providing automation, security, improved collaboration and more.

The Infinite Scale Illusion: Navigating Pitfalls and Limitations of Large-Scale Computing on Azure
=============================================================================
In the ever-growing adoption of cloud computing, actuarial computations demand robust, scalable solutions.

This presentation dives into a system developed entirely in .NET Core, designed for large-scale batch computations in the finance & insurance domain. We explore its dual capability to operate seamlessly both on-premises and within the Azure cloud environment, underscoring the flexibility and maintainability of a monolithic architecture in distributed systems.
A focal point is the system's strategic utilization of Azure's offerings, such as rapid elasticity, to enhance computational efficiency and scalability while keeping operational costs at a reasonable price. However, the cloud's distinct characteristics also introduce specific challenges. Throughout this session, we will dissect several pitfalls encountered while adapting to the cloud's unique features. We deep dive into working practices and strategies to navigate these complexities effectively.
Join me on a cloud journey, gradually embracing its unique capabilities, while still maintaining full on-prem support. Let’s demystify some of the marketing promises towards infinite scale. Let’s find out Azure’s limits, why using a mix of IaaS and PaaS can be a valid choice and finally, why many teams would do better by embracing Monoliths over Microservices, especially when scaling to over 150 Virtual Machines.

Project Kappa - Or how we successfully failed to avoid our own Serverless platform
=============================================================================
Sometimes things look similar but are fundamentally different. Pasta with bacon and cream is not a Carbonara, the Mega Drive never was a Super Nintendo, and whatever Serverless solution you use, it is not AWS Lambda.

While all of those comparisons make for some inner turmoil, especially the latter one caused severe problems when we tried to move our Serverless workloads to Azure. Simply because they do come with a challenge: Every developer at Dynatrace, every partner, and every customer should have the possibility to run privacy-first, isolated, and secure workloads on top of our data lake infrastructure.
In this talk, we will look at how Dynatrace managed to run their Serverless workloads on Azure, with a tailor-made, Kubernetes-based Serverless platform we so dearly tried to avoid at all costs. Not only will we look at the architecture at hand, but we will highlight every right decision that was paramount to solving this problem as painlessly as possible.

Infrastructure as Code and AI - does it fit?
=============================================================================
Infrastructure as Code is crucial for the cloud native development. It allows you to automate the deployment of your resources and comes with a lot of other benefits.

How does Infrastructure as Code harmonize with AI tools like the GitHub Copilot?
I wanted to investigate the matter and examine how well AI tools can be applied to several use cases related to Infrastructure as Code: for code generation, code interpretation, and error analysis. I intend to publish the results of this session.

Transforming diverse system landscapes into sustainable API products with Azure API Management
=============================================================================
Well-designed, secure and fast APIs are the backbone of many successful digital products. While APIs need to fulfill specific product-related needs, developers must think of security, monitoring, versioning and many further topics for creating a long-lasting robust API. Especially when dealing with a heterogenous system landscape as the starting basis, the integration of different sources into a unified clean API product is a key factor for enabling faster adoption by app developers while making full use of existing data.

Discover how Azure API Management revolutionizes API integration and development being a hybrid, multicloud management platform for APIs across all environments. Learn the secrets of analytics-driven decisions, as Azure API Management delivers insightful usage metrics, error diagnostics, and latency analysis while also providing the necessary tools for versioning and lifecycle management. With just a few steps developers can easily abstract backend diversity while securely exposing services hosted inside and outside of Azure. Let’s explore how Azure API Management can help you providing a centralized platform for managing manifold aspects of your APIs.
